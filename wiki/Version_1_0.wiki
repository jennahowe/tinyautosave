=Version 1.0 release notes=

This is the first release of the !TinyAutoSave plugin.

It is currently in production at Lottery Post ([http://www.lotterypost.com/ www.lotterypost.com]), a Web site with very high traffic volume, and which uses TinyMCE as its forum editor.

The plugin has been performing well over a stretch of time at Lottery Post, providing the confidence to do a general release at this time.

==What's new==

There are currently four different technologies used in this first release of the plugin.  Depending on the adoption rate of HTML 5 storage features, additional client-side storage techniques may be added in a future release.

==Download==
