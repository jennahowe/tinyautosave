# Version 1.0 release notes #

This is the first release of the TinyAutoSave plugin.

It is currently in production at Lottery Post ([www.lotterypost.com](http://www.lotterypost.com/)), a Web site with very high traffic volume, and which uses TinyMCE as its forum editor.

The plugin has been performing well over a stretch of time at Lottery Post, providing the confidence to do a general release at this time.

## What's new ##

There are currently four different technologies used in this first release of the plugin.  Depending on the adoption rate of HTML 5 storage features, additional client-side storage techniques may be added in a future release.
